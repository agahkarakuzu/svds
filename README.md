# Statistics Visualization Data Structure

This is a pet project aiming at describing a set of simple, yet useful, data structures that can facilitate generation of interactive figures and web-based visualization interfaces for statistical analyses performed on scientific data.

The idea is to decouple statistical computation from rendering of interactive/reactive features using Java Script Object Notation (.json) files, bringing following advantages:

* Increasing responsiveness of interactive operations  
* Providing cross-platform/language compatibility
* Reduction of the lie factor


### Preliminary list of methods

Each plot will be associated with a set of standard key-value pairs.

* Bland-Altman
* Intra class correlations
* Minimum detectable change
* Shift function
* Bootstrapped comparison of correlations
* Umbrella plots
* [Pearson](https://github.com/agahkarakuzu/svds/blob/master/Pearson.md)
* [Spearman](https://github.com/agahkarakuzu/svds/blob/master/Spearman.md)
* [Concordance](https://github.com/agahkarakuzu/svds/blob/master/Concordance.md)
* Skipped
* Percentage bend
* Bivariate descriptive
* Univariate descriptive
